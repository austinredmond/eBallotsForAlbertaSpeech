# eBallots
 Code to automate populating a Google Form's drop-down lists.

# Acknowledgement
 This script was written using Melinda Waffle's guide on Creating a Drop-Down
 list from a spreadsheet column. The original guide can be found at the URL
 http://wafflebytes.blogspot.com/2016/10/google-script-create-drop-down-list.html

# Purpose

 The script is to be used with Google Sheets and Google Forms. Add the script to
 a Google Sheet that is linked to a Google Form. After configuration, the
 Google Form will have the relevant drop-down lists be automatically updated to
 reflect changes made when editing a list of valid options in the Google Sheet.
 
 The variable names reflect that this script was designed to be used to support
 eBallots for an ADSA-style speech tournament.
